### Data Generator for B/Event-B Predicates and Operations/Events

This repository contains a data generator which crawls the B/Event-B predicate data published at [hhu-stups/prob-examples-metadata](https://github.com/hhu-stups/prob-examples-metadata/tree/master/b-predicates).

For each predicate, a set of explicit positive and negative input examples is generated.

The ground truth consists of the B/Event-B operators that have been used in the predicate.

Moreover, arbitrary directories can be crawled for B/Event-B machines to generate data describing the components needed to synthesize an operation's/event's substitution.
